# OctoPyTweet

This is a simple script to tweet stats and pictures for print jobs running on an OctoPrint print server. It is called from cron once a minute.
This would be better if it was an OctoPrint plug-in but what can you do. It works and I don't have time to learn how to make a plug-in right now.
